Project Name: My Planner - Work Day Scheduler

Project Description:
My Planner - Work Day Scheduler is a browser-based application that allows users to plan and save events for their workday. It provides a simple calendar interface where users can add important events and view them in a dynamic manner. The application highlights the current hour in red, grays out previous hours, and displays future hours in green. The user's data is stored safely on local storage.

User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to add important events to my daily planner.

Approach:
For this project, I utilized the provided HTML and CSS files and leveraged the power of jQuery to dynamically manipulate and update the calendar events in JavaScript.

Responsiveness and Media Queries:
This project does not require responsiveness or media queries.

Technologies:
This project is primarily built using JavaScript, with basic HTML and CSS.

Deployment:
I deployed the website using Git commands such as Git Clone, git add., and git push. I also shared a live link for review.

License:
I have added the MIT license to this project, making it freely available for anyone to use.
